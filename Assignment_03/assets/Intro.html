        <h3>About Maharashtra</h3>

        <h4>At a Glimpse</h4>
        <p>
            The<b> beautiful state of Maharashtra is situated the north centre of
            Indian</b>peninsula is<em>bordered by the states of Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and
            Andhra Pradesh</em>. The western cost of the state is splashed by the vast Arabian Sea.
            Maharashtra literally means the "Great State" or "Great Nation". The name
            is believed to have been originated perhaps from the word Rathi, which
            means <b>"Chariot driver" and "builders of chariot"</b> who were called as
            "Maharathis" or "Fighting Force". Known for its amazing natural beauty and
            rich cultural heritage, Maharashtra is one of the most industrialized
            states of India. Some of the prime cities of Maharashtra include
            <mark>Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Shirdi, and Kolhapur.</mark>

        <h4>State Tourism</h4>
        <p>
            Maharashtra is one of the most <b>popular tourist destinations in India</b>. 
            Maharashtra tourism offers almost everything from pristine beaches, wildlife sanctuaries, hill
            stations, natural caves, waterfalls, to imposing forts, colourful
            festivals, ancient pilgrimage shrines, museums, and historical monuments
            that draw large number of travellers. Tourism in Maharashtra is one of the
            fastest growing industries, which brings in a lot of foreign exchange and
            has led to the generation of employment in the state. In order to increase
            the influx of domestic and international tourists,<em>Maharashtra tourism came up
            with some aggressive promotion campaigns and strategies</em>. The <i>department launched its
            "Maharashtra Unlimited"</i> campaign in domestic and overseas markets to create awareness about tourism
            in Maharashtra and to popularize Maharashtra travel destinations. Maharashtra
            tourism is also developing infrastructure like hotels and transport at
            major tourist destinations, and has identified several new Maharashtra
            tourism circuits and special tourism areas, which would be given priority
            in tourism related infrastructure development.

        <h4>Getting Around</h4>
        <p>
            Maharashtra Transport as well as private buses run throughout the length
            and breadth of the state. Taxis, semi deluxe buses, and auto rickshaws are
            the best mode of transport for covering shorter distances. Another
            important means of transport in Maharashtra are the passenger trains,
            which connect all major cities of Maharashtra. Besides this, some of the
            cities in Maharashtra, like <b>Mumbai</b>, have their own suburban railway
            network, through which people can move from one locality to the other.
